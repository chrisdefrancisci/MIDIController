# MIDIController
This is the Arduino code used for my Design, Cultures, and Creativity capstone project, which aimed make music education more accessible.

The Arduino recieved input from two shift registers, which held the value of the notes that were being played, and a potentiometer, which was used to control a tone parameter.
